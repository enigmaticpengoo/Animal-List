July 2023

First project using React, Typescript, and Bootstrap.

This app is front end only.

Displays a list of animals with pictures and information. Can like animal cards, search for animals, and filter the animals.

Also has some unecessary Navbar buttons, I had planned on converting this to be part of a portfolio website but never got to it.
